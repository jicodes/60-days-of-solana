### The IDL (Interface Definition Language) 

- Interface Definition Language is a JSON file that describes how to interact with a Solana program. It is automatically generated by the Anchor framework.

### What is #[derive(Accounts)] macro?

- The #[derive(Accounts)] macro simplifies the process of defining and handling
  the context for Solana instructions in Anchor.
- It ensures that all the necessary account validations and deserializations are
  automatically handled.

### What is #[account] attribute?

- `#[account]` is an attribute that is used to specify the account that is used
  in the function.

### Accounts IDL key

```json
{
  "name": "accounts",
  "accounts": [
    {
      "name": "signer",
      "signer": true
    },
    {
      "name": "another_signer",
      "signer": true
    }
  ],
  "args": []
}
```

`args` is an empty array because the function does not take any arguments except the context.

### ctx: Context\<StructName\>
- The `ctx` is a `Context` struct that is used to pass the accounts to the
  function.


### Summary:
- Solana uses an IDL (iInterface Definition Language) to show how to interact
  with a Solana program and what fields appear in the IDL.
- The struct modified by #[derive(Accounts)] and how it relates to function
  arguments.
- Anchor interprets `snake_case` functions in Rust as `camelCase` functions in
  the Typescript tests.
